📑 Kaggle Notebooks

Welcome to my Kaggle Notebooks Repository!
This repository showcases my work in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through Kaggle competitions and real-world datasets.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science & Analytics at SUNY Polytechnic Institute, and this repository reflects my hands-on learning, experimentation, and competition experience.

🔍 About This Repository

This collection demonstrates:

📊 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🤖 Machine Learning Model Development

⚙️ Model Tuning & Cross-Validation
